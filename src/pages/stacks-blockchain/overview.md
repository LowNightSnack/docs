## Introduction

Stacks 2.0 is an open-membership replicated state machine produced by the coordination of a non-enumerable set of peers.

To unpack this definition:

_A replicated state machine_ is two or more copies ("replicas") of a given set of rules (a "machine") that, in processing
a common input (such as the same sequence of transactions), will arrive at the same configuration ("state"). Bitcoin
is a replicated state machine — its state is the set of UTXOs, which each peer has a full copy of, and given a block,
all peers will independently calculate the same new unspent output (UTXO) set from the existing one.

_Open-membership_ means that any host on the Internet can join the blockchain and independently calculate the same full
replica as all other peers.

_Non-enumerable_ means that the set of peers that are producing the blocks don’t know about one another — they don’t know
their identities, or even how many exist and are online. They are indistinguishable.

## Roadmap

Stacks improvement proposals (SIPs) are aimed at describing the implementation of the Stacks blockchain, as well as
proposing improvements. They should contain concise technical specifications of features or standards and the rationale
behind it. SIPs are intended to be the primary medium for proposing new features, for collecting community input on a
system-wide issue, and for documenting design decisions.

-> See [SIP 000:](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md) for more details about the SIPs process.

## Testnet phases

- ✅ **Local Testnet** is a developer local setup, mono-node, assembling SIP 001, SIP 002, SIP 004 and SIP 005. With this version, developers can not only run Stacks 2.0 on their development machines, but also write, execute, and test smart contracts. See the instructions below for more details.
- ✅ **Open Testnet** is the public testnet that was shipped with SIP 003 and SIP 007. It is an open-membership public network, where participants can validate and participate in mining testnet blocks.
- [ ] **Mainnet** is the fully functional version, that we're intending to ship in Q3 2020.

## Stacks 2.0 features

### Clarity Smart Contracts

A Smart Contract is code running on the Stacks Blockchain that executes autonomously. When your Smart Contract has no
room for errors, Clarity is here to help. Clarity is the safest language for writing Smart Contracts, optimized for
predictability and security.

### STX Mining

Anyone can be a Stacks Miner. There are no special hardware or software requirements, all you need is Bitcoin. Instead
of spending energy, Stacks miners transfer Bitcoin to holders of Stacks Token (STX) to mine a block. This mechanism is
called Proof of Transfer (PoX).

### Proof of Transfer (PoX)

-> Proof of Transfer is in active development

Proof of Transfer (PoX) is a consensus mechanism that leverages the security and stability of Bitcoin to create a new blockchain, without modifying the Bitcoin protocol.

With the PoX mechanism, miners use Bitcoin to secure the Stacks 2.0 network. By anchoring onto the Bitcoin network, it is practically infeasible for malicious actors to have enough computational power or ownership stake to attack the Stacks 2.0 network.

PoX makes it also possible to reward Stacks token holders with bitcoins, a feature called **Stacking**.
